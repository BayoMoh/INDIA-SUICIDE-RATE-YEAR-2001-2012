 # Skills Demonstrated
 • Data cleaning
 
 • Quick measure
 
 • Filters
 
 • Visualization

 # Data Transformation
 The kaggle csv file was imported into Microsoft Excel using power query to clean and transform the data. Tables which won't contribute to insights and recommendation needed at the end of this analysis were removed and they didn't by any chance have any negative effect on the result that would be derived.
 
 No mathematical operation was performed throught the analysis.

 # Modelling
 No modelling was required because all the data was contained in one excel sheet.
